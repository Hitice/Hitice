👋 Hi, I’m @Hitice, always passionate about coding, though I’ve never done it professionally.
👀 I’m interested in cryptography, blockchain, UX design, and automation.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, Ledger, and AWS.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on crypto tools, graphic design, and CNC building.
📫 You can reach me at adm.nuvem@protonmail.com.
😄 Pronouns: Pavanelli.
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve built 5 CNC machines, with my latest capable of cutting aluminum, wood carving, and engraving. It uses a 24k RPM spindle, Nema 34 motors, and Mach3. I also built a Core XY 3D printer, which allowed me to create some amazing projects.
